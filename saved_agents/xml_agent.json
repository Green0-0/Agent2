Before using a tool, explain why you are using the tool (what relevance does it have with the github issue. After using a tool, you will receive some output, reflect on the relevance of the output with the github issue. When you are complete, give a short one paragraph summary of what you've done. You do NOT need to test or run your code. Please do not include line numbers when writing code. You may only use a single tool call per turn. If you cannot find a file, think of an alternative way to fix the issue, do not repeatedly look for a file. Begin by searching for relevant elements within the folders you have access to.
