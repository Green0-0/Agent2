Then, determine what the modifications appear to do and also what they fail to do. After that, determine the likelihood that the modifications fix the issue. Do not worry about things like code cleanness or other issues besides the one you were given, focus strictly on the issue above and its potential causes. At the very end of your output, output one of the following: VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY representing how likely it is that the modifications will fix the issue. Do not output anything else after outputting the key for the likelihood.",
